# FaceDetectionWebCam

This is a precise and efficient code, to detect your face via openCV library.
Fortuately opoenCV has already been trained on many images so it doesn't need explicit training from the end user, which makes the library all the more usefull.

The System should have a web cam for the program to use it as a resource to capture live iamges frame by frame.
